Final Project: Sleeping Counting Sheep 

Individual Project 

It is a game that I was right about sleep. This is because nowadays there are many sleepwalkers 
who stay up late at night on their smartphones. 
This application is the user set the number of sheep in which 
about to go to sleep and then start the sheep animation going 
happening. 
This will have a label that will be counting how many sheep have been skipped 
grid, with additional buttons that allow the application to stop and sleep, other than 
allows you to increase the sheep because you do not even sleep and finally a button to choose 
music to sleep. 
If you point your limit and your sheep and this reaches the end 
the application automatically shows a window saying you have a good 
night or if you want to continue not sleep and counting sheep to fall asleep 
you increase the number of sheep to count.
